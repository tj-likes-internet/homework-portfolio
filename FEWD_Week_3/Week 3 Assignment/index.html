				<h2>How I Implemented Relaxr in 2 weeks and changed my life.</h2>
					<img src="images/blog_photo1.jpg">
						<p><span class="bigassl">L</span>o and behold, another start-up that claims they know how to automate your entire life. I know what your thinking, but give me a second to explain why Relaxr is not "just another Start-up". But first, I have to tell a story. See those people canoe racing in the super green lake in the image above? Take a close look at the man in the front of the farthest boat with the big ass drum. Know who that is? That's me. Living my dream of making loud noises and always being at the front. All the sudden a bass the size of a mammoth jumped out of the water and swallowed half my crew. Just moments before I was living a work free life and the next half my friends are fish food. So before you download Relaxr, think about that. My life is changed alright. What i'd give to go 2 weeks back.</p>

						<p><span class="bigassl">L</span>But it’s so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy’s? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I’m not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
						Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. Yes — Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder’s origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.</p>
